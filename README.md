## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Browser-based JavaScript

### Challenges faced

#### Responsivity

- **Problem:** Adapting the component to different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) was a challenge.

- **Solution:** CSS Flexbox and CSS Media Queries were used to create a responsive layout. The component was tested on various devices and screen sizes to ensure a good user experience.

#### Accessibility

- **Problem:** The component's low accessibility for visually impaired users was an issue.

- **Solution:** To ensure the component's readability for all users, colors were adjusted based on accessibility tests conducted using tools such as Accessibility Insights and Lighthouse. The alternative colors (#67788f, #ffffff) offer better contrast and make it easier to read for people with low vision.

#### Performance optimization

- **Problem:** Ensuring fast loading times and smooth performance was a major concern, especially with CSS and JavaScript files.

- **Solution:**
  - The CSS was minified.
  - The `defer` attribute was used to load the script.

### Continued development

- **Accessibility:** Make the social media sharing menu accessible for keyboard users.

- **Performance optimization:** Reduce the size of challenge images to improve page load time.

### Useful resources

- [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/overview/) - A comprehensive tool for performing accessibility testing on websites. It was used to check the component's color contrast.

- [Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lighthouse) - A tool developed by Google that helps optimize websites, including aspects such as best practices, performance, accessibility, and SEO.
